# Firefox addon for bookmarking GFG important questions
When I click on the extention a form opens which asks for title and content. Now as I have made this to bookmark questions that I feel important and directly add the link and title of the question directly to a google sheet, so that I can access that database from any device. I thought to use firebase as my database but chose google sheet because of it's easy to access and I can edit the sheet as the way I want.
